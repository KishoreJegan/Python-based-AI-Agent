# Python-based-AI-Agent
Executed a python based AI Agent using llm langchain ,langgraph and GROQ API
Unlike a standard LLM that only knows what it was trained on, this agent has access to "tools" (Web Search and a Calculator) and possesses "memory" to remember your conversation history. It runs locally in your terminal but uses the powerful Llama 3.3 70B model via the Groq Cloud.
